            <img src="images/sutro_baths_vintagepic1.jpg" alt="vintage sutro bath artistic image">
            <p>One of my easiest picks was the huge piece we recently acquired of the Sutro Baths, the enormous seaside bathhouse that once stood at Land’s End on the western edge of San Francisco. Built in 1894, the massive facility offered seven pools that could accommodate 10,000 swimmers, and held 1.7 million gallons of seawater at high tide.</p>

            <p>This classic Swiss travel poster was created by G. Boccasile over eighty years ago, and is notable for its striking color and subtly glamorous composition. A recent addition to the gallery, it’s a beautiful piece that is unlikely to remain in the collection for long.</p>

            <img src="images/Parapluie.jpg" alt="yellow background with artisitic umbrellas from a birds eye view">
            <p>Created for the Revel umbrella company in Lyon, France, this is one of Leonetto Cappiello’s most effective designs, and the single most well-known modern poster image. Considered the father of modern poster art, Cappiello’s imaginative approach to his craft is legendary, and his ouevre is without peer. </p>

            <img src="images/ChexPanisse.jpg" alt="vintage artistic woman with red hair drinking wine">
            <p>Part of a recently acquired collection by famed Bay Area illustrator David Lance Goines, this piece depicting a red-haired woman enjoying an impossibly tiny aperitif is singular. Created just one year after Chez Panisse opened their doors in 1971, it’s among Goines’ best.</p>
